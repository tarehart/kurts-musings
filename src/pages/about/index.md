Kurt Arehart is an amateur writer years into
a richly enjoyable retirement. Nearly all of these
writings were created since.

He hired on with General Electric directly out of
Penn State and stayed his entire 38 year career,
first as a financial accountant, then product
developer with GE Capital, and for the final 26
years, a range of product development and
industry analyst roles in the Mortgage Insurance
business of GE and then Genworth.

The urge to write was always hovering in the
background, but came forward only when
retirement became possible and Kurt stepped
off into the creative space allowed by daily
freedom and leisure.

Kurt also actively travels, rides bikes on dirt,
gravel and pavement, skis, hikes and plays the
ukulele.

And he sometimes puts on the shop apron and fixes bicycles for and with the at-risk and
homeless through Raleighâ€™s Community Kickstand.

Kurt also continues to offer financial literacy workshops for at-risk youth, mostly at the high
school level, though these gigs are far less frequent in retirement.

In other words, he keeps it varied and seems not to obsess on any one thing for long. So no
massive novel can be expected.

Kurt and Nancy Arehart have been married since 1984 and are going strong, with adult sons
Tyler and Coleman up and out in the world.
