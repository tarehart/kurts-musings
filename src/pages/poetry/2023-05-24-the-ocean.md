```
Perhaps four years of age, she looked so small
Like a painting save for her blowing hair.
She faced the sea watching the crashing wall.
She seemed in awe hung in the moment there.

Me thinks t’was first she saw the mammoth sea
Stretching far distant meeting with the sky.
Water and blue as far as she could see.
The wonder kept her mute; no question “why?”

How long she stood I do not really know
Since I myself was caught in this time frame.
While watching her my wonder too did grow.
Something within would never be the same.
