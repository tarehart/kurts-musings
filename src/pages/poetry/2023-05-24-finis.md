```
The gold dipped sun rose through the blue.
        Pushed mist and clouds away.
Its light danced on the cold, crisp air
        and formed the Autumn day.
Then with a need to show its strength,
        the wind broke into song,
And turned and twisted through the leaves
         to bid them come along.
Arrayed in colors of the Kings
         the leaves came swooping down
To sail unhampered through the air
        landing on rain soaked ground.
For days such beauty filled the world.
        We humans call it “Fall”.
Then with a blanket of fleecy white 
        he softly covered all.
