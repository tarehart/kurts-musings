```
She caught a cold
    And went to bed
And took a pill
    To clear her head.

She played some soli-
    taire and read
And coughed and read
    And blew and read.

Though weak she found
    That she could dial
And called a friend
    To talk awhile.

She banged upon
    The ivory keys
And tried to play
    A tune to please.

So bad, she felt
    She even tried
Some medicine
    Her Mom prescribed.

Her appetite
    Stayed with her though.
She ate right through
    A TV show.

She got so bored
    She even tried
To clean the place
    Where we abide.

And found to her
    Complete dismay
She’d rather be
    In school today.
