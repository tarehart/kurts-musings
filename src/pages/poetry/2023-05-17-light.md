```
A memory, - a memory
But one that lives on down through time.
And through the years that come and go
These thoughts will forever be mine.
‘Twas Sunday eve the seventeenth,
The stars were seen bright in the sky.
Days were busy for everyone
And Christmas was breathed in each sigh.

There at the place on the corner
The lights of the St. James Church shone.
Many stood there in the quietness
Closed in by those walls as though one.
The silence made each heart tremble
And hope as it never had done.
Seeking to see through the darkness
The light which the candles begun.

The light to carry the story
Of God and His love for all time.
‘Til not a soul would breathe the air
That didn’t have God’s name in mind.
Then one by one every candle
Touched the one beside ‘til the flame
Was there upon you candle too
And you passed it to me, - just the same.

And then the silence was broken
But the words that broke it were grand.
The Pastor asked in a prayer
That this light go on through the land.
A memory, - a memory
But one that lives on down through time.
And through the years that come and go
These thoughts will forever be mine.
