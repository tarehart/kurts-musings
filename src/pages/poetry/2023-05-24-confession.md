```
Don’t close the door
    but say Goodnight
Before you shut
    me from your sight.
I cannot hint
    to have a kiss
But I’d reply
    if you’d insist.
Perhaps you think
    it wrong somehow
For me to be
    here with you now.
Your work kept you
    from going tonight.
Now homeward bound
    I saw your light.
And could not pass
    your house and so
Found an excuse
    to say “Hello!”
But now the seconds
    speed till I
Now see it’s time
    to say “Goodbye”.
And through your door
    I nobly step.
Though you have failed
    to catch on yet.
The story can
    not end like this.
And that is why
    I stole a kiss.

            your girl.
