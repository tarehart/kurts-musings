Stillness.

I stand in chest deep water, pleasantly cool.  I feel the water completely, free of clothes.

She lay balanced on my hand as light as a bird.  Trusting, utterly relaxed, in the isolation of buoyancy, limbs settling to their natural jointing.

Long hair spreads darkly in a corona around a finely made head, tilted back to find the point of effortlessness.

Lit by a bright moon, her face, well known and loved, is seen anew as it glistens in this silver light.

Moments before her breasts had hung in casual beauty.  Now they lightly flatten, held as they are by the water, their form captivating.

Her lower torso lay mostly submerged, with only a hint of defining strength finding the surface.

Two points of pelvis form little islands, framing a light garden of fine sea grass, waving slightly in some unfelt current.

Stillness.

There is nothing else.



-----------------------------



Erie, Pennsylvania was a tough place to stay positive in 1980.  The lake-effect weather served up an abundance of wet, cloudy days.  The concurrence of sunshine and a weekend was a festival event, not to be squandered.



These were rust-belt days.  While the cleanup of Lake Erie was well along and swimming in the lake was no longer madness, the shore was still dominated by heavy industry adding its own pallor to the grey skies.  My own employer, GE, was no exception.  Here we did heavy manufacturing, most prominently locomotives, and had our own foundry that spewed its share of toxins into the air.  To me it seemed that anyone with promise and vision was working on some means of leaving Erie for brighter skies and prospects.



This was not always so.  When I first arrived in 1977 I insisted on focusing on the positives of the area and was consistently upbeat in the face of fellow new-hires who gave voice to negative assessments.  Over two year’s time our roles reversed.  Now I was the one keen on getting out with career intact, while they reconciled to the local scene.



Faced with being shunted into an uninspiring green-eyeshade job and the prospect of a lifetime of grim drudgery, I took the risk of openly declining the offered career path and was rewarded with a move to GE’s financial services business in Stamford, Connecticut.



This was bright and heady stuff:  I had stayed true to my employer, my coworkers and myself, had seized control of my life, and now was headed to a land of wealth and endless opportunity.

And expense.  Compared to Erie, Stamford was fabulously expensive.  Rents were far too high for the relatively modest salary increase I had received with the move.  I would have to somehow find a roommate, someone to share the cost of renting an apartment or house.  Al Gore had yet to invent the internet, so one searched for housing in the classified section of the Stamford Advocate.  There I found it:  rooms for rent in a house owned by a fellow who lived on the property in a separate structure.  Close to work.  Affordable.  No clue who the other two room renters would be, but at age 25 this seemed a minor risk.  Done.



A day after I had settled in the two other renters arrived and presented themselves.  Sharon and Wanda.  Close friends, their most striking tie was that each was deeply involved with an Olsen brother:  Wanda with Gary, and Sharon with his older brother Karl.  So I was the second Karl, and immediately acquired the nickname “K2”.  Not so bad.  K2 was the noted peak in the Himalaya and also a prominent ski maker and the “kay-too” rolled off the tongue nicely.  And the nickname served as a constant reminder that Karl Olsen was Karl number one.



Both Sharon and Wanda were in their late twenties, physically attractive, were each dealing with impasses in their relationships with the brothers Olsen, and so had each decided to make themselves less available, and hopefully more attractive.  In Sharon’s case this was to become weekdays at the rental house, and weekends up at Karl’s place in the hills of North Stamford.

In a few week’s time Wanda, Sharon and I became good friends and learned a lot about each other.  



Wanda was an authentic Connecticut trust-fund girl, who had a good sum of cash coming her way in a few years' time, and was trapped in motivational morass.  She dabbled as a travel agent, tended some bar, worked on her high society entertaining skills, and counted heavily on the coming funds to carry her until she could marry a man of means.  Someone like Gary.  I found her to be good company, enjoyed her cooking immensely, and marked her as a sort of manipulative, ambitious, financially demanding woman to steer well clear of.



Sharon was completely different.  Three years my senior, she was a genuine child of the sixties who had attended Kent State, placed flowers in rifle barrels of National Guardsmen called to campus to quell war protests, and knelt in horror over the bloodied form of a friend struck dead when the bullets flew.  Now she worked as a graphic artist, was very progressive in her world view and was to me devastatingly attractive in her black Danskin top and jeans.  A willowy, fit 105 pounds with fine honey-colored hair often worn up and beautifully shaped breasts, it was as if she were made specifically to tempt me.



And yet.  She was very committed to Karl O, who seemed a nice enough fellow and maybe 10 years older and a good bit wealthier.  Within a few weeks I had met him, visited his extensive wooded property,  and come to understand that Sharon had lived with Karl for several years and had only recently moved out in order to bring the relationship to resolution, one way or the other.  So Sharon and Karl were engaged, kind of.  But she had moved out.  Kind of.  In sum, I saw Sharon and Karl in a long term and serious relationship, and so kept myself on a tight leash, enjoyed our deepening friendship, and suffered my infatuation in silence.



Within two weeks of becoming roommates and friends, Wanda, Sharon and I realized that collectively we were paying our landlord a monthly sum that would fetch much nicer digs in a more attractive part of Stamford.  Wanda quickly found a gorgeous garden condominium flat overlooking a lushly landscaped pool that was within our combined means and we promptly walked out on our enraged landlord who was again with an empty rental house and only our one-month security deposits to ease his pain.



Now we were living in style.  I would come home from work at GE Capital and loosen my tie as Christopher Cross’s crooning wafted over hardwood floors along with the scent of some delicious appetizer that Wanda had prepared, and a glass of white wine was thrust into my hand.  We would sit out on our balcony overlooking the pool, and thus the evening began.  This was a very long way from Erie, Pennsylvania.



A single male in Fairfield County, Connecticut, gainfully employed, mid-twenties, with strong financial prospects and no obvious character flaws was a rare and valuable thing in that time.  Sharon and Wanda would amuse themselves by inviting girl friends for drinks or dinner so that I might meet them and further expand my circle of new friends.  



But I met Trudy at work.  She was unlike anyone I had met before. Perfect porcelain skin, baby-bow mouth, small and pretty features.  Big blond hair in the Fara Fawcett mode, popular at the time.  Stylish, designer everything, she was quite at home in spike heels and tailored suits.  Her cosmetics case had heft and substance.  And for some reason she was interested in me.  Trudy demanded to be treated like a lady in the high formal way and would wait while I came around the car to open her door for her, yet complained of any gender inequity she found limiting.  She struck me as extremely cosmopolitan, and if I was with her, I suppose that made me a cosmopolitan man.



We met in GE Capital’s in-house cafe, and suddenly we were dating.  Having recently fallen off the turnip truck from Erie and hungry for the shiny big city scene, I confess to being vulnerable to her charms, eager to learn her rules of refined behavior.  Her strategy was to move quickly to the brink of intimacy, set the hook, and then hold me at arm’s length and expertly play me like a sport fish.  Satisfied with her total control, she began to tell me how it was going to be.



Trudy was born into money, grew up with money, and planned on working at GE Capital just long enough to catch a man with strong earnings prospects.  She shared with me her dream:  summers with the children at the country club pool, with the monthly tab for their comforts taped to the inside of my locker.  I would come upon it after a round of golf with my fellow senior executives and chuckle at her charming excesses.  How I could hear this and not run screaming from her mystifies me to this day.

One Sunday Trudy was keen to rent a tandem and tour along the Connecticut Gold Coast for a few miles past the fabulous homes looking out upon the sound.  We made a pretty couple and I imagine she wanted me to see what we should be aspiring too.  The tandem was old and heavy and as I worked hard to ride it up the occasional short hill I found that Trudy was not contributing to the effort at all.  I remember concluding to myself that I would never agree to another tandem ride.  The now obvious metaphor for our entire relationship went unnoticed at the time.



We planned a weekend visit with my parents in Philadelphia.  Trudy was insistent that we take a high end hotel room while I expected we would simply use the guest room in my parents tidy little Cape Cod style home where we were fully welcome, making for a better visit and saving a lot of money in the bargain.  Trudy wanted the hotel room so her make-up and hair could be perfect at all times in my parent’s presence.  This was theatre for her, not an opportunity to sincerely know and be known by my parents.  



Bob and Helen Arehart have always been kind, virtuous and unpretentious and lived simply and frugally.  They had absolutely no frame of reference for understanding Trudy.  Nor did I, in retrospect.  I stuck to my guns and there was no hotel room, we stayed in my parents home, Trudy was boiling mad, and my parents were equal parts bewildered by Trudy  and concerned for me.  I must have been nearly vibrating with tension.  The drive back up to Connecticut Sunday afternoon was chilly and quiet.  It was over.



And I felt great about it.  Whatever spell she had cast upon me was broken, I could see clearly, and counted myself very lucky to have received this education with no real harm done.  My mother in particular was ecstatic to receive the news.



And so were Sharon and Wanda.  They too had been watching this spectacle with growing horror and were thrilled to learn I had broken free of a bondage that would have crushed the life out of me.  They immediately threw a big welcome-back-to-sanity party for me featuring a fine meal and more girl friends trotted by for my consideration.  I was grateful for the opportunity to browse the eligible women from the comfort of my living room, but there was a problem.  Sharon was again in front of me:  so real, so deeply attractive in her straightforward authenticity, so unavailable.  I ached for her but it was not to be.  She was kinda-sorta engaged, right?



A few weeks later I was in the half-bath across the hall from my bedroom scrubbing my teeth with the door left open.  A hand snaked in and gave me a playful squeeze on the bottom, and was gone, clearly intended to provoke a reaction.  My eyes went wide.  A drive-by shooting, and that was Sharon!  In the mirror I had seen her strolling down the hall toward me just before.



In the next few moments awareness grew.  Maybe my hopeless and bottled-up infatuation was not completely one-way.  Maybe I had been blind to signals of greater welcome or unconsciously framed them as pure friendship.  Maybe this fantasy was coming real.  Surely the question was now squarely in front of me.  What to do?



I was an official graduate of GE’s Financial Management Program, a two-year grind of rotating through six-month assignments (to rapidly provide a broad base of experience in financial accounting) and challenging classwork (to provide the GE equivalent of an MBA and cull hopefuls who wilted under the intense pressure of exams that led to dismissal if failed).  Graduation tagged you as a young elite, worthy of rapid progression in a GE career.  I had survived this pressure-cooker and then transferred to Connecticut so rapidly that I had moved before the official graduation party, an opulent affair.  I was offered the opportunity to attend the same sort of graduation dinner, but with the Connecticut-based program survivors, to be held at the Patterson Club, a well-heeled country club in Fairfield, very near GE’s global headquarters.  I had been weighing whether or not to bother attending, since I would not know a soul there.



Inspiration, in the form of a drive-by bottom squeezing, had struck.  Less than a day after this revelation, which had passed without any comment from either of us, I took my chance.



“Sharon, how would you like to play Corporate Wife for an evening?”



I explained that in two day’s time I had a very fancy, very dressy corporate dinner to attend, and I needed a date.  There would be a few brief speeches to endure, but otherwise it was a glittery evening of fine food and drink.  Neither of us were making a lot of money, so such a chance was not to be missed.



Sharon accepted with no hesitation.  I was a little surprised and a lot thrilled.  Really thrilled.  I had no idea where this might lead, but the thought of being out with Sharon, of even pretending to be a couple, had me deeply happy.  We were going to put on our best finery and try it out in a country club dining room.



A thing that is known, that is certain, will become normalized, common.  This time with Sharon was the polar opposite.  I had no idea what might follow.  No reason to believe that our one night together as a couple would ever be repeated.  No reason to doubt that at the evening’s conclusion Sharon would reassert her kinda-sorta engagement with Karl.



As our evening began I had no sense of pacing, no say or control over what happened next.  No clear sense of what was in bounds, what was not.  I was just happy to be with her in that moment, playing at being a couple.  And so I was fully present and accepted each moment as a special gift, to be cradled with significance in my hands, regarded in silence for a beat, and then lovingly opened.



The country club dining room was splendid and the evening was hosted by a senior leader and his wife.  After cocktails we were seated for dinner.  This was 1980, and the dozen or so local graduates were men, and all of the women their wives.  The host stood to speak.  He commended we graduates on our important achievement and made much of what our futures with GE now held.  He welcomed our wives and spoke of the sacrifices they made as their husbands worked long hours and studied into the night to secure their family’s success.  Sharon found my thigh under the table at this point in the speech and gave me a squeeze.  She now better understood what we were playing at and how she was cast for the evening’s performance, and was enjoying herself all the more. 



The speaker’s wife was seated next to Sharon.  Her antennae were waving about and she could sense the energy of a young love between Sharon and me. To Sharon:  “So, my dear, how long have you and Karl been married?”



“Oh, we’re not married.  This is our first date”, Sharon chimed back, a note of mischief in her voice as her hand slid a bit further up my thigh.  I managed a neutral expression.



The speaker’s wife frowned in distaste that so weighty an evening be invaded by an uninvested woman.  A woman who was a little too attractive, having a little too much fun, and lacking the stamp of GE wife, fully committed to her man’s run for wealth and power, hoping against hope to one day live grandly and preside over many such evenings.



Had I been in direct working contact with the senior leader now speaking, the disapproval of his wife would be dangerous ground.  He could make or break my career, and if his wife was sharpening her blade for me there would be trouble. But I truly was out of place, the odd interloper, working three towns over and in a completely different part of GE.  This incident would drop from her thoughts soon enough and my path would never cross her husband’s  again.  No harm done.  Probably.  



On arriving home late into a Thursday night we found our neighbor’s windows darkened and Wanda not in our condo flat.  She might be out for hours yet, given her recent pattern.  Sharon poured two glasses of white wine, gave me a peck on the cheek and suggested a midnight swim, and we separated into our rooms to change.  



We made our way back down from our flat, me in trunks with a towel draped over my shoulders, Sharon in her robe, each toting our stemware.  The pool was dark, well past quiet hours, unlit but for a bright moon. There were no lamps on anywhere and all was still.  Private enough.



In her natural and direct way, without a word Sharon let her robe slide off her shoulders and stood revealed to me.  She was a study of light and shadow, her beauty beyond my imaginings.  This was magical and I was transfixed.  The evening had brought yet another lovely and unexpected gift.



A few strides and she had slipped into the pool.  She was wise to be quiet, not wishing to call a sleepless neighbor to a window, and I did the same.  We embraced in the water.  Never had I known the rapture of such perfection.  Then she gently leaned away from me to lay back and float upon the water in a gesture of openness and trust.  I wondered at how her body needed just the lightest touch from me to find its balance upon my hand.



-----------------------------------------



After a time the water cooled us.



In silence we toweled off and padded up to the empty condo flat.  More gifts to open.
